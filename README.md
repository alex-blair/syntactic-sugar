This is the first website I ever made. It's a blog covering topics we were asked to write about during Phase 0 of Enspiral Dev Academy's 18-week web development programme. Aside from technical topics, we were asked to read Chapters of "Search Inside Yourself" by Chade-Meng Tan and write about our experiences practising mindfulness.
