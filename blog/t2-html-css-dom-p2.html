      <h2>Grid-based design</h2>
      <p>
        This week we learned about grid-based design. I'm so glad this is a thing! Only 1 week in and it was already getting difficult to fit everything on my Homepage. Grid-based design allows for more organised and systematic layouts. At a simple level, it involves dividing the page into a number of columns and rows. Twelve (12) is a convenient number of columns to begin with, as it can be divided into separate groups of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Content can then be arranged using the grid structure so that it appears on the page in a balanced, symmetrical or eye-catching way.

      <h2>Responsive webpages</h2>
      <p>
        Something I didn't think about much until recently - how do you make a website look good on different sized screens? Turns out it's not one-size-fits all when it comes to design. You have to plan for these things. Responsive webpages resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move content to make it look good on any screen. One way to create a responsive design is through CSS media queries. These allow you to set max and min sizes for content so that when the screen size changes, the content adjusts too.

      <h2>Semantic structure</h2>
      <p>
        "Semantic structure" sounds like something an English lecturer would scrawl on an assignment in red pen. In the dev world, though, it's the idea of formatting different sections of code with logical tags such as "header", "nav" and "footer". This gives the structure of a webpage more meaning ("semantic" = "relating to the meaning of a word"). HTML5 incorporates these special tags, so instead of having to create a specific class and apply it to a div tag, developers can simply use tags with names like "header" and "footer". This makes it easier for developers to achieve consistency in how they use semantics while designing web pages.

      <h2>Playful placeholders</h2>
      <p>
        I've been frustrated by the amount of empty white space on my homepage this week. I want to fill it with something, but couldn't decide what, so I was excited to learn there are whole websites devoted to placeholder images. My favourite so far is <a class="reference" href="http://placehold.it/">placehold.it</a>, but there's also <a class="reference" href="https://placekitten.com/">placekitten.com</a> and <a class="reference" href="http://www.fillmurray.com/">fillmurray.com</a>, if you'd prefer pictures of kittens or Bill Murray.
