            <h4>Javascript vs HTML and CSS</h4>
            <p>
              This week I was transported back to my high school days of problem solving in maths, using a part of my brain that's mostly been on vacation these past few years. Welcome to the world of JavaScript! Time to get back to work Brain, you slacker.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far we've been learning about HTML, the bread and butter of websites, and CSS, what you use to make everything pretty. Now we're starting to learn JavaScript - the thing that makes websites interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript tells the browser how to change the web page in response to certain events (like a user clicking on a link, or filling out the details of a form).
            </p>
            <h4>Control flow and loops</h4>
            <p>
              Control flow is the concept of controlling how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met. One way to do this is through if/else statements. These tell the browser to run code if certain conditions are true. Using an everyday example, you might choose to set yourself a limit of 6 cups of tea a day. In this case, if you have had less than 6 cups on a particular day, you could make yourself a fresh pot, else you'd have to stick with water. Here's an example of this if/else statement in code:
            <pre><code>var cupOfTeaTally = 3
if (cupOfTeaTally < 6) {
  console.log ("Put the kettle on!");
} else {
  console.log ("I think you've had enough.");
} // Put the kettle on!</code></pre>
  (Except this example doesn't really make sense, because you can never have too much tea.)
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wanted to run a piece of code a number of times, you could keep writing it out until you got the right result, but that's a bit time-consuming. Loops allow you to carry out an action multiple times without having to repeat yourself. For instance, if you wanted to list of all the cups of tea you had gone through in a day but you didn't want to write the same sentence over and over you could use a <strong>for</strong> loop like this:
              <pre><code>for(i=1; i<21; i++){
  console.log("This is cup number " + i);
};</code></pre>
            </p>
            <h4>Arrays and objects</h4>
            <p>
              Arrays and objects are used to store multiple values in a single variable (<code>var</code>). For instance, if you wanted to store a range of muffin flavours in the variable "muffins", you could use an array as follows:
              <pre><code>var muffins = ["blueberry", "banana choc chip", "apple cinnamon"]</code></pre>
              Numbers are used to access the values (or "elements") of an array. In this case, <code>muffins[0]</code> returns "blueberry" (arrays indexes start with 0).
            </p>
            <p>
              An array is a special type of object. One major difference between an array and an object is that you use names to access the values in an object, rather than  numbers. For instance, in the example below, <code>cake.filling</code> returns "jam":
              <pre><code>var cake = {type:"sponge", filling:"jam", number: 3};</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrays are best when you want your element names to be numbers. Objects should be used when you want the element names to be text.
            </p>
            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>
              A function is a "subprogram", made up of a sequence of statements, which can be used to perform a particular task. As Code Academy puts it: "a function takes in inputs, does something with them, and produces an output."
            </p>
            <p>
              Functions can be declared using:
              <pre><code>function nameOfFunction(parameter) {
  console.log("Print the word " + parameter);
};</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              To use a function, you "call" the function by typing the function's name and putting a parameter value inside the parentheses after it e.g. for the above example, <code>function("Hello")</code> would output <code>"Print the word Hello"</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Functions are useful because they allow you to use the same piece of code over and over without having to write the whole thing out again. You can use the same function with different values (or "arguments") and it will produce different results.
