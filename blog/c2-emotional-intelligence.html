          This week I read Chapter 1 of "Search Inside Yourself", by Chade-Meng Tan (a.k.a the "Jolly Good Fellow" of Google).
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter's focus is on developing emotional intelligence through mindfulness. In the words of Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally" (p. 34). The chapter looks at the benefits of mindfulness (which appear to be numerous) and provides some beginner's tips for practising. There were a few parts I found particularly interesting:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "...emotional competencies are not innate talents; they are learned abilities" (p. 27). So EQ isn't fixed. That's encouraging to know.
          </li>
          <li>
            The book discusses a method of controlling emotions called "affect labelling", which means labelling feelings with words. The idea is that if you label each emotion as you experience it (e.g. "I feel nervours", "I feel angry"), you'll be able to better manage your feelings.
          </li>
          <li>
            I liked the discussion on how emotions are not just psychological experiences, but also physiological experiences. E.g. if you are getting frustrated your body might start tensing up (having made some pretty silly coding blunders in this week, I know the feeling well). Chade-Meng Tan encourages the reader to start looking out for these physiological cues, arguing that they can help people put names to their feelings, which will then make it easier for peopel to deal with their feelings.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried practising 2 minutes of mindfulness after reading the chapter. There was a point around the 1 min 40 second mark where I was beginning to feel really calm and was finally able to focus on my breathing, but before I knew it my alarm was going off. Next time I'll probably try it without the stopwatch and see how it goes.
