            <h4>The compassionate leader</h4>
            <p>
              This week we're reading Chapter 8 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>. It talks about compassion, which is described as <em>"a mental state endowed with a sense of concern for the suffering of others and aspiration to see that suffering relieved"</em> (p. 155). It then goes on to look at how compassion creates highly effective leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book refers to one study that looked at what makes a success manager. Researchers found that the biggest difference between the top quartile of managers and the bottom quartile were their scores on affection:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>"The highest performing managers show more warmth and fondness toward others than do the bottom 25 percent. They get closer to people, and they are significantly more open in sharing thoughts and feelings than their low-performing counterparts."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              That finding doesn't surprise me at all. Managers who seem self-interested or unsympathetic are far less appealing to me than ones who try to get to know their employees and understand individual points of view. Someone I used to work with (who was an incredible leader, though I'm not sure he knew it), once commented <em>"I think real leaders bring people along with them; they don't just cut loose those who disagree with them."</em> That comment stuck with me, because it seems so applicable to teamwork in the working world. Just because you can make people follow you, doesn't mean you're a leader. People have to choose to follow you before you can claim that title.
            </p>
            <h4>The SCARF model</h4>
            <p>
              Chapter 8 lists five domains of social experience that our brains treat as primary rewards or threats (i.e. things that are so important to you your brain treats them in the same way it treats survival issues). These are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Status - your relative importance. People go to great lengths to protect or increase their status.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certainty - brains love certainty. It's hard to stop thinking about an issue that hasn't been resolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Autonomy - the perception of exerting control over your life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Relatedness - whether someone is a "friend" or "foe"; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fairness.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Together, these factors form the SCARF model. Understanding how to increase these factors can apparently help you work better with others. I think certainty and relatedness have been important factors in Phase-0 of this course. Talking to others and learning their working styles (i.e. increasing relatedness) has made pair coding easier, and feeling like I'm up-to-date with the sprint concepts (i.e. increasing certainty) has made the course work less stressful. I think in the next part of the course autonomy will play a bigger role. When the weeks start going past in a blur and we get closer and closer to starting our final project it will be good to still feel in control in some way.
            </p>
            <h4>A difficult conversation</h4>
            <p>
              Chapter 8 also sets out some insights and an exercise for difficult conversations. When I think of difficult conversations, I think of situations where it's difficult to separate the emotions surrounding a topic from the topic itself. One of the insights in the book is that we shouldn't equate impact with intention (p. 169). E.g. just because we feel hurt or offended by something someone said, doesn't mean that person intended to hurt us. So when we're having a difficult conversation, we should bear that in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of preparing for a difficult conversation, the book recommends talking to other people and bouncing ideas off them. I do that a lot. If nothing else, it gives me an opportunity to vent some frustration, which means I'm calmer by the time the real talk rolls around. I remember one conversation I prepared for, after I'd been working long hours for quite a while, and was beginning to feel burnt-out. I wanted some more time off, but I had no idea how to broach the topic. So I started running through the problem with a friend, and realised that a far better solution than simply asking for a break, was asking for more flexibility to manage where and when I did the work, so I could set aside some time for myself each day. In the end, the conversation went really well. But then, my boss was pretty great, and probably would have understood either way.
