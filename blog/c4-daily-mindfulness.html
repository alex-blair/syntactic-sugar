            <h4>A 'mindfulness conversation'</h4>
            <p>
              This week we were asked to try a 'mindfulness conversation', which involves listening to another person for 4 minutes without interrupting, then repeating back what you think you heard (called "looping").
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried this with my partner, and noticed the following:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The listen and loop process forced me to empathise, because I had to pay close attention, and since I wasn't meant to add new things once my partner finished talking, the part of my brain that would usually be working on formulating a response was turning over what he was saying.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Listen and loop seems more valuable for sorting out feelings than facts. Repeating back the facts my partner mentioned was easy, almost mechanical, but when it came to summarising his feelings I had to really think about it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The conversation somehow felt luxurious, like dining at a restaurant with thick linen rather than paper serviettes. The topic wasn't deeper or any more meaningful than the things we usually talk about, but giving it all of my attention made it more of an event.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Sustaining mindfulness</h4>
            <p>
              There are a lot of things I tell myself I should do every day, like exercising for at least 30 minutes or fitting in 10,000 steps. I know these things will be good for me. I want to make time for them. But sometimes I just can't be bothered. I need to get better at making these things into habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search Inside Yourself suggests three techniques for sustaining mindfulness practice:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Find a buddy to practice with you and hold you to account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do less than you can, so that it feels like an indulgence rather than a chore.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take one mindful breath a day. Everything else after that is a bonus.
                </li>
              </ul>
               My favourite of these is number two. I like the idea of fitting in a few minutes here and there, as a little break from busyness. I think it also makes sense to build mindfulness into things I'm already doing, like eating, walking, and talking to others, because then I'll be prompted to practice it throughout the day. I came across this quote, which I think sums up my ideal practice quite well: "Enjoy simple things with total intensity. Just a cup of tea can be a meditation." (~ Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh).
