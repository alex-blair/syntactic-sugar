- "Concatenate" = link (things) together in a chain or series. As in "If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined"". Jacob thought this term was commonly known. It's not, Jacob. It's not.

Wonder how many people bought webcam covers after that episode of black mirror.

var myTotal = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i + 1) {
  myTotal += myArr[i];
}

Received warning message that "i + 1" would create an infinite loop that would crash my browser. Backed away slowly.

Jacob has been incredibly patient at answering questions.

"There's no magic" - but that doesn't mean you won't spend 2 hours looking for a missing bracket.

That time I got stuck

I've been told "there is no magic in programming", and once you realise that it becomes a whole lot easier to solve problems. i.e. the function you wrote is returning an error message because you've forgotten a semicolon, not because your computer has somehow gained sentience and has decided to behave different from all other computers.

The "no magic" thing seems like a good place to start, but it didn't prevent me from going in circles for two hours the other day when I was stuck on an assignment. I was trying to select all the elements in an array using the .childrenproperty, then loop through each element using a for loop and classList.contains to check for certain class properties. I was pretty I was using the right language, but it wasn't working and I had no idea why.

I spent a while googling key concepts, but that didn't give me an answer. I then tried googling the error message, but that didn't help either. So I tried a mixture of pseudocode and the "rubber ducky" method (where you describe the problem you're having to an inanimate object like a rubber duck, except I was working in a room filled with other people and didn't want to look crazy so I typed my explanation in a blank email).

By the time I had typed out 80% of the problem I was trying to solve, I felt like I knew the topic pretty well. I was also pretty sure I was on the right track with my answer. So I turned back to my code with fresh eyes, and -

  there

         was

              no

                  closing

                           bracket.

*Sigh* How did I miss that? Compare that to earlier this week when I had to work through this problem -
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

I started by breaking it down into pieces of pseudocode (e.g. if number divides by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz') and asking myself lots of questions (e.g. how do you work out if a number divides by another number?). I came up with the following solution:

for (var count = 1; count < 101; count++) {
  if ((count % 5) + (count % 3) === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (count % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz")
  } else if (count % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz")
  } else {
    console.log(count);
  }
}
