            <h4>The three Ps of happiness</h4>
            <p>
              This week we're reading Chapter 6 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, which talks about motivation. The chapter starts with the idea that personal happiness is a big motivator, so if you want to feel more motivated at work, you should try to understand the things that make you happy. Not only that, you should try to find the things that make you sustainably happy (because chips might be great, but if you eat 3 bags in a row you probably won't feel as happy at the end as you did when you started). The chapter groups happiness into three different forms:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pleasure - a fleeting type of happiness that you get in little doses here and there. If the doses stop, or you become accustomed to whatever is bringing you pleasure, then you'll return to your default happiness level.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Passion - <em>"where peak performance meets peak engagement"</em> (p 112). Those moments when you're fully immersed in a task that's both challenging and interesting, and you wonder how it suddenly became night-time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Purpose - when you're a part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Passion and purpose are presented as more sutainable forms of happiness; the idea being that you're less likely to grow accustomed to them. The book encourages readers to think about their higher purpose, suggesting that if you can then find a way to serve that purpose in your day-to-day work, your work will become a sustainable source of happiness for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of this "discover your higher purpose" exercise, we've been asked to think about our core values. One of mine is acting in a way I'd like to see others act, particularly when it comes to reducing waste. I'm not big fan of people who preach a certain way of life and then don't stick by their words. But I do think everyone has the potential to influence the people around them in a positive way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The book also talks about emotional resilience. This is the idea that optimistic people aren't optimistic because their lives are perfect, but because they are resilient and view failure in a different way to pessimists: <em>"When an optimist suffers a major disappointment, he responds by figuring out how he can do it better next time. In contrast, a pessimist assumes there is nothing he can do about the problem and gives up"</em> (p 125). I like the idea of reframing failure in this way: as a temporary setback that can be overcome through effort and ability, rather than a permanent state of affairs. It makes failure seem like part of the adventure; like a short "oops" moment in a longer, epic montage.
