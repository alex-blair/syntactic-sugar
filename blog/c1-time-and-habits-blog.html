    <h1>Timekeeping and Habits</h1>

    <h2>The Pomodoro Technique</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class ="list">
        Work for 25 minutes then take a short break.
      </li>
      <li class ="list">
        After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break.
      </li>
      <li class ="list">
        Thoughts? I've found that short breaks tend to spiral into long breaks when I don't carefully plan all the tasks I want to get through in a few hours.
      </li>
      <li class ="list">
        Advantages: a sense of satisfaction as I checked things off my to-do list, and was able to really enjoy the breaks without feeling guilty.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset</h2>

      <ul>
        <li class ="list">
          Fixed mindset - believing that your talent is fixed, and that if you don't have the right level of natural talent, you won't be able to do something.
        </li>
        <li class ="list">
          Growth mindset - believing that your talents can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence.
        </li>
        <li class ="list">
          To move from a fixed to a growth mindset - start small. Prove your ability to yourself in a thousand tiny ways, and let your confidence grow naturally from there.
        </li>
        <li class ="list">
          Advantages of a growth mindset: there's always room for improvement. You can get better if you work at it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Experimental Study Habits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class ="list">
          Start small. The hardest part is getting started,  so start really small and build momentum from there.
        </li>
        <li class ="list">
          "Work expands to fill the time available for its completion" - give yourself less time to do a task, and you'll get through it faster.
        </li>
        <li class ="list">
          A little guilt can be a great motivator. Set deadlines that you can't ignore e.g. by promising someone else that you'll give them the work to review by a certain date.
        </li>
      </ul>
