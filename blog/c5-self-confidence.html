            <h4>Mindfulness vs self-awareness</h4>
            <p>
              This week we were asked to read Chapter 4 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> and think about the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness described in the book.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Self-awareness: Recognising your emotions and their effects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Self-assessment: Knowing your strengths and limits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Self-confidence: A strong sense of your self-worth and capabilities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Chade-Meng Tan describes a linear relationship between the above factors - that strong emotional awareness leads to more accurate self-assessment, which in turn leads to higher confidence. In the end, he notes that self-awareness is essentially mindfulness. Both are trainable, both can be developed with practice.
            </p>
            <h4>Becoming more self-aware</h4>
            <p>
              The book describes some ways of enhancing self-awareness. One of these is keeping a journal. I've done this before, and I always find it quite relaxing. Sometimes I start writing because I've got a problem that seems impossible to solve, and by the end I realise the whole thing's not as difficult as I thought. This metaphor from the book captures it nicely: <em>"the moment you can see a raging river, it means you are already rising above it"</em> (p. 78). By the time I've accurately captured something in words, I usually have a much better understanding of it and what needs to be done.
            </p>
            <h4>"My Emotions Are Not Me"</h4>
            <p>
              This heading sounds like something you'd mutter to yourself after discovering someone has used a metal spoon on your best non-stick pan. It's one of the key points in Chapter 4. Basically, it comes down to the idea that <em>"emotions are simply what you feel, not who you are"</em> (p. 90). I guess that means that when you find the pan, and notice your frustration levels rising, you should realise that what you're feeling is just a temporary state, and learn to move past it.
