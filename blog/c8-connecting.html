            <h4>Trust</h4>
            <p>
              Chapter 7 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> looks at building trust. We've been asked to think of a time when we tried to grow trust, and how it went. I tried this recently with a friend who I didn't think could keep a secret. Little by little I started telling her more things, letting her know which things were private and which were public, and seeing how it went. It seemed counter-intuitive at first - sharing more information in the hopes that she would share less. But it helped.

            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Think of a difficult situation from your past, when there was some conflict or disagreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now describe the situation as though the other person is 100 percent correct and reasonable.
                </li>

              A while ago I bought a compost bin for our flat. I wanted us to put all our kitchen scraps in it so we could reduce waste and I could use compost in the garden. The neighbour thought this was a bad idea. I'll try to look at the situation through from his perspective:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                our houses are very close together;
              </li>
              <li>
                compost bins can attract pests like flies and rats;
              </li>
              <li>
                it would suck if flies or rats came onto my property because someone was feeding them and helping them breed with kitchen scraps.
              </li>
            </ul>
            As a note, I didn't get rid of the compost bin, but I've become a lot more selective about the sorts of things I put in it. Because yea, pests aren't great.
