            <h4>Triggers</h4>
            <p>
              This week we're reading chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, which talks about triggers - seemingly small things that cause a disproportionally large emotional response in us (e.g. when a casual comment touches a nerve and causes someone to blow up). Some things about triggers I found interesting:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  they almost always have long histories behind them; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  they're often connected to a perceived inadequacy about ourselves that is a source of pain to us.
                </li>
              </ul>
              We've been asked to think about some of our triggers during programming. I think one of mine is when I've spent a while double-checking my code, and I refresh the page to see if the changes worked, and then nothing happens (or worse, everything breaks). I usually have to take some deep breaths at that point, and start going through my code line by line again to try and work out the problem. Thankfully, the book introduces a really good way of dealing with triggers. Introducing...

            <h4>The Siberian North Railroad exercise</h4>
            <p>
              The Siberian North Railroad, or SBNRR, is an exercise that gets you to Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect and Respond. E.g. if someone says something critical about your work, and your immediate reaction is to think of a defensive statement, then putting the SBNRR exercise into action, you'd first have to pause, breathe and notice what you are feeling. You'd then have to reflect on why you're feeling that way and try to put yourself in the other person's shoes. Finally, you'd have to imagine a more positive response (whether you actually go through with that positive response is up to you).
            </p>
            <p>
              I like the way this exercise forces you to pause, and recognise that you're about to react in a certain (probably unwise) way. In theory it's possible to whip through all the SBNRR steps in just a few seconds, which I think is very cool and a bit of a sci-fi (like you're somehow slowing down time to have an in-depth heart-to-heart with yourself without the other person being any wiser).
