<h1>Musings</h1>

<p>
It's the end of Week 1, and I'm pretty excited. I think it's going to take me a while longer to get into the full swing of EDA, but I already feel like I have a way better idea of what's to come.

Shereef's Fireside Chat is a goldmine of inspiration. The way he describes the bootcamp experience is both reassuring and motivating. I have to say though, when he said "I'm hoping people have been prepping for more than 12 weeks" before the onsite course, I felt a little panic. It's just the beginning and I'm already running to keep up. Things will hopefully get easier after Christmas once I finish my job.

Anyway, I thought I'd jot down my favourite parts of the talk for future motivation:

<ul>
  <li>
    We're all in this together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be hungry to learn. Strive for a creator mindset, rather than a consumer mindset.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be patient with yourself while you're learning the basics. Don't push to be really creative from the start. Creativity will be easier once you're familiar with skills.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't be afraid to expose your ignorance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Being a developer involves reading code more than writing it. So read other people's code. Comment on it. Learn from it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get out of the mindset that you're in school and that you shouldn't look to others for the answer. There is no single answer. Coding is a craft. Look for inspiration everywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pace yourself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stop when your brain is no longer working - at the point you're putting your empty cereal bowl in the fridge.
  </li>
</ul>

I think it's quite easy to get caught in the trap of thinking "I've done all my assignments, that's good enough." But from what I've heard in the last week, successful EDAers do a lot more.
