            <h4>That time I got stuck</h4>
            <p>
              I've been told "there is no magic in programming", and once you realise that it becomes a whole lot easier to solve problems. i.e. the function you wrote is returning an error message because you've forgotten a semicolon, not because your computer has somehow gained sentience and has decided to do its own thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "no magic" rule seems like a good place to start, but it didn't prevent me from getting stuck on an assignment for two hours the other day. I was trying to select all the elements in an array using the <code>.children</code>property, then loop through each element using a <code>for loop</code> and <code>classList.contains</code> to check for certain class properties. I was pretty sure I was using the right language, but it wasn't working and I had no idea why.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent a good while googling key concepts, but that didn't give me an answer. I then tried googling the error message, but that didn't help either. So I tried a mixture of pseudocode and the "rubber ducky" method (where you describe the problem you're having to an inanimate object like a rubber duck, except I was working in a room filled with other people and didn't want to look crazy so I typed my explanation into a blank email).
            </p>
            <p>
              By the time I had described out 80% of the problem I was trying to solve, I felt like I knew the topic pretty well. I also felt pretty sure that I was on the right track with my answer. So I turned back to my code with fresh eyes, and immediately saw - </p><pre>  there

         was

              no

                  closing

                           bracket.</pre>
              *Sigh* How did I miss that? Anyway, I had a much easier time with this problem:
            <p></p>
            <p>
              <em>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by breaking it down into pieces of pseudocode (e.g. if number divides by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz') and asking myself lots of questions (e.g. how do you work out if a number divides by another number?). I came up with the following: <pre><code>for (var count = 1; count &lt; 101; count++) {
  if ((count % 5) + (count % 3) === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (count % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz")
  } else if (count % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz")
  } else {
    console.log(count);
  }
}</code></pre>

              I've found pseudocode quite useful for getting my head around problems (even short problems like this). Below are some other problem-solving techniques we've been introduced to (if pseudocode isn't your thing).
            </p>

            <h4>Problem-solving techniques</h4>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - describing what the computer must do in your own words rather than a programming language. Good for when the jargon is muddling your thinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trying something</strong> - As simple as it sounds. Just try something - even if it's only a small part of what you're hoping to achieve - and build confidence from there.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - confide in an inanimate object. By the time you've finished describing your problem to the rubber duck (or whatever object you choose), you'll hopefully have a much better understanding of it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - read the error message and try and understand it. If you don't, copy and paste it into google. If you still don't, try another method.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Console.logging</strong> - get your computer to print the result it's come up with at different points of the program and you'll be able to pinpoint what-went-wrong-where more easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Googling</strong> - exactly what it sounds like. I've been impressed with how many information-packed sources there are online.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - they might have just spent an hour stuck on the same problem as you, and know your pain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Asking your coaches for help</strong> - if your peers don't know, ask the experts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I feel like this is something that will help you get better at solving problems over time, rather than an in-the-moment aid, but worth keeping in mind.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Three JavaScript functions</h4>
            <p>
              In case you are curious, here are three JavaScript functions summarised in very simple terms:
            </p>
            <h6><strong>.map()</strong></h6>
            <p>
              Can be used to apply a formula (or function) to each element in an array. E.g. if you had a list of numbers and you wanted to find the square root of each one, you could use the <code>.map()</code>method with an appropriate function and it you return you an array of square roots (one for each number you passed through the equation).
            </p>
            <h6><strong>.filter()</strong></h6>
            <p>
              Can be used to sift through values in an array. Say you have a function that will return "true" if a person's age is greater than 25. If you were given a list of different ages and you didn't want to go through all of them individually, you could use <code>.filter()</code> with the function and in return you'd get a list of all the ages over 25 (presented in an array). E.g. <pre><code>var ages = [40, 12, 26, 31];

  function checkAge(age) {
      return age > 25;
  }

  function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = ages.filter(checkAge);
  }</code></pre>
              The result here will be <code>40, 26, 31</code>
            </p>
            <h6><strong>.reduce()</strong></h6>
            <p>
              <code>.reduce()</code> can be used to reduce an array of values to a single result. 
            </p>
          </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
