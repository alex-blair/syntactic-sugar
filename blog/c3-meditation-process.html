            <h3>Process over product
            </h3>
            <p>
              The mantra this week was "process over product", which means a focus on learning rather than on a perfect end product. I'm actually really glad this was the express mantra, because without it I probably would have spent way longer mulling over dream website features and venturing down design rabbit holes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being told "just write anything, it doesn't matter if it's good at this point" has been extremely helpful for getting past what I find the toughest hurdle - starting. Once I get that first thing written down, the project tends to pull me in and next thing I know I've raced through a whole chunk of work. But starting is hard. Cup of tea? Check. Comfortable seat? Check. Did I put the washing on? Let me just quickly check... I can fall into a frustrating cycle of preparing to work, but actually not getting past the first step. So I'm glad this week's focus has been on process - it's much easier to trick myself with "just do 5 minutes of work" and then end up spending an hour, then to psych myself out with "when you start, you better make sure you can create a design masterpiece in one sitting".

            <h3>A beginner's guide to meditation</h3>
            <p>
              This week I finished reading Chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, which provides a basic rundown of how to practice mindfulness, including the best posture to adopt and what to do if you get distracted by other thoughts (just "Gently bring your attention back to your breath" - p. 50). I've read other descriptions of mediation in the past, but I like Chade-Meng Tan's technical approach. He doesn't discuss meditation in a purely idealistic way. He also gives the reader tips for practising mindfulness in their day-to day interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              At one point, he describes how you can practice mindfulness while listening to another person talk about their day. He makes it sound so simple - just give that person your full attention. Actually listen to what they're saying instead of thinking about other things. Since reading that, I've felt myself sitting up a bit straighter and focussing more when I'm taking to others. They're only small changes, but I find myself thinking about them a lot and wondering why I haven't tried to be more mindful before. It somehow makes every interaction feel more special - like a moment to be appreciated rather than another part of the day to get through.
